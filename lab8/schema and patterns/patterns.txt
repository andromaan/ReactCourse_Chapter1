In the BooksTable component, I used a few key design patterns. The Presentational and Container Components Pattern keeps the UI logic in BooksTable separate from the state management in BooksContainer. 
Conditional Rendering allows the table to switch between displaying book details and input fields for editing, creating a responsive interface. The input fields are Controlled Components, linking their values to the state for real-time updates. 
Lastly, I added Validation to ensure required fields are filled before saving changes, which helps maintain data integrity. These patterns make the component modular and user-friendly for managing book entries.
